# This is my readme file. 
It is gonna tell you cool stuff about what this repository is about and the different components of my project like:
## My name, it's Jesse Hurtado
This file was created for my [BDA 594](https://sdsu.instructure.com/courses/162125).
### My definition of Big Data
I define **BIG DATA** as the massive, nonuniform, and unstructured heaps of information generated by human activity that exist on the global web, and the internet of things. 

### Editing README from inside VSCODE.
This is test text that I am adding to test out the compatibility of Github desktop interfacing with my local text editor, VScode.
